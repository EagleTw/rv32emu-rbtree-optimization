# rv32emu-rbtree-optimization

![linux-map vs jemalloc-map](./img/bench-plot.png)

## Overview

This project focuses on benchmarking and optimizing the red-black tree-based map used in rv32emu. The goal is to improve performance, memory efficiency, and execution speed through profiling, algorithmic refinements, and potential jemalloc-style enhancements.

This project aims to enhance the performance of [rv32emu](https://github.com/sysprog21/rv32emu) by addressing issue [#29](https://github.com/sysprog21/rv32emu/issues/29).

## Features

- ðŸš€ Benchmarking & Profiling: Measure insert, delete, and lookup performance.
- ðŸ”§ Optimizations: Improve memory usage and execution speed.
- âš¡ Integration with rv32emu: Enhance existing map structures.
- ðŸ“Š Comparative Analysis: Test against alternative data structures.

## Results

The following data represents the average time of 20 experiments, each involving the insertion, finding, and deletion of 10 million randomly generated nodes in a random order. The experiments were conducted on an Apple M1 Pro (10-core) processor.
